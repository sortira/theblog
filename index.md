Hello everyone, this is my personal blog. No, I do not intend to share life stuff or yet-another-college-life-drama-blog (I'm aware the URL doesn't say WattPad). No, I intend to use this as a showcase of whatever little I hope and aspire to build and achieve. By the way, my name is **Aritro Shome**. More on me later.

By choice, I am a programmer. The art of building the most intricate entities in perhaps one of the most intellectual activities (other than chess ♟️) simply appeals to me more than anything else. I look forward to collaborating on projects, so feel free to contact me! 

But by no means do I fit the recluse-programmer-stereotype. I am an avid debater 🗣️ and hope to do Model United Nations (MUNs) in the future, alongside being a seasoned quizzer and a QuizMaster, basketballer 🏀, swimmer 🏊, and ah, yes, not-so-good CounterStrike die-hard fan (s1mple, please return to Na'Vi 🎮).

Now, **who am I?** It is a Linux command of course, but apart from that, as I already said, my name is **Aritro Shome**. I appeared for my boards in 2024, securing a percentage of **96.8%** in the science stream, which was the highest in my school, *M.P. Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School*. In my 10th Board Exams, I had a percentage of **98.8%** which secured the second highest in my school and also earned me an **All India Rank of 6** and a **State (West Bengal) rank of 5**. In my competitive examinations, I secured 98.489050%ile in the JEE Mains examination with a CRL rank of 24108, 2155 rank in the WBJEE examinations, 2100 rank in the IISER Aptitude Test, but sadly, I couldn't crack the JEE Advanced examination. I'm currently pursuing engineering at the *Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur*, Kolkata, West Bengal.
