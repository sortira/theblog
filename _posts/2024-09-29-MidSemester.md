Note to future self: the decision to write a blog post the night before the ecology exam will probably boomerang back to hurt me but if you've known me for the last five years, you know I rarely give two shits about subjects like ecology. 

College has been hectic. 9am to 4.35pm classes, 100% of which do not even relate to my major. But then, Indian Education System. If I want to change it, gotta give UPSC and if you're an Indian, you know the chances of selection for a _general male financially decent_ candidate can be assumed to be zero. 

But there's a lot of silver lining to unpack. Amazing seniors, the guidance they've given regarding my life's dream hobby of programming is just a gold mine. Whatever the internet had me stumbling about, they provided the clarity much needed to succeed and excel. I will actively do CP and dev after the midsems end. 

Also, deleted Windows. Happy Linux to me.

PS: Keeping it short because even though I don't give two shits, I need the GPA.
